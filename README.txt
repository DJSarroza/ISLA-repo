ABSTRACT:

Intelligent Story Layout Assistant (ISLA) is a forward-chaining narrative planner based on 
Stephen Ware's GLAIVE. It constructs story layouts that achieve the author's goals while making 
sure that \textit{most} steps in the plan have clear motivations. These layouts, or solution 
plans, are based on a handcrafted knowledge-base of story universe elements. The current output 
is capable of displaying the underlying motivations of each action, and  state transition 
information. The output is also presented in two ways: 1) a relatively human-readable series of 
paragraphs and 2) a detailed state transition sequence. The objective qualities of the narrative 
outlines being generated are measured, quantified, and analyzed. Some limited machine learning 
techniques are also employed in an effort to refine the elements of the knowledge-base. As a 
whole, ISLA has the underlying data structures needed to potentially further assist the author 
in fleshing out the produced story layout.
